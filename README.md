# Coding with my Daughter - Nurturing the Next Generation of Coders with AI

This project aims to empower the next generation of programmers by combining traditional programming skills with cutting-edge AI technology. We're sharing our journey, lessons learned, and code in an open-source format.
This code is part of the project presented on LinkedIn, here: [#1](https://lnkd.in/e5jSZpcz) [#2]( https://lnkd.in/eUxDYXYg) [#3](https://lnkd.in/eu928q_p) [#4](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emmanuelchriqui_ai-llm-mlops-activity-7233796884396478464-mwT2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) .

## Project Overview

We started with a classic: Pong. But we didn't stop there! We expanded it into a 3D game, developed a server hosting hundreds of auto-playing Pongs, and incorporated an AI language model to enhance our program. The goal was to have the AI assist us in answering questions, generating ideas, and improving our implementation.

## Lessons Learned

Our experience with AI was eye-opening. We discovered that providing context is crucial for successful collaboration. Simply sharing code wasn't enough; we needed to transmit our goals, intentions, and problem-solving approaches clearly. This realization led us to rethink how we approach programming and working with AI.

## Technical Details

We used C# and .NET 8, Visual Studio, ChatGPT, Claude and a local LLaMA with the LLaMA3 model.

## Focus Areas

Our project blended technical knowledge with practical wisdom, focusing on:

    Designing and testing programs

    Experimenting, logging, debugging, and exploring concurrency approaches

    Delving into core computer science concepts

    Integrating AI technology as a powerful enhancer of programming capabilities


## Key Takeaways

    Traditional programming skills can be amplified by embracing cutting-edge AI tools.

    Guided, hands-on experience yields the best results for skill development - by far!

    Experienced programmers sharing their expertise accelerates skill growth for both mentors and learners.
